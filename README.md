# Installation
Our project is based on the Relational Deep Learning Benchmark(RelBench), so you need to first install RelBench using ```pip```
```
pip install relbench
```
Additionally, our project requires [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), [Pytorch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric) and [Pytorch Frame](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch-frame). Please install these dependencies manually or do:
```
pip install relbench[full]
```
